# Former N&N Hospital
The main website for Former Hospital.

This website is an online museum of sorts with lots of pages of interesting information and interactive activities. It is also easy to navigate, only requiring the keyboard (but you can use the mouse as well). As I am doing this as a hobby and not doing it for profit, feel free to copy and manipulate the source code (however do not use media included without gaining permission from the respected sources).

This project was made by Sebastian Doe ([git.sebdoe.com](https://git.sebdoe.com)) in 2019. All permission was gained for use of media in this project that is not owned by me. **Respect the source.**
